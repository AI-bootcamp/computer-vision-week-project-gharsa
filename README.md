## ðŸ“– About the Project
So, our project is about helping who wants to plants small & beautiful things but they may have limited resources (like only soil), and we could help in two things for the users:
1. First, they could upload a soil picture
    - From it, we can classifies which/what the soil type is.
    - And tehn, we could recomend a plants/crop
2. Maintaing your plants!!
    - If the users sees un-expexcted things on their leaves; they can upload a picture of the leaf (only one leaf which they are suspects of)
    - We could detect the leaf and which disease has affected the leaf.
    - Whether it affected by:
        1. Burns on the leaf
        2. Spots/Rots on the leaf
