## üìñ About the Project

Gharsa aims to assist users with limited agricultural knowledge or resources by offering:
1. **Soil Classification & Crop Recommendations**: Upload a soil image to classify its type and receive crop suggestions.
2. **Plant Disease Detection**: Upload a leaf image to detect diseases like burns or spots/rots and get actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. Soil Classification & Crop Recommendation
- **Upload Soil Image**: Classify soil types using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Crop Suggestions**: Recommend suitable crops based on soil type and agricultural best practices.

Supported Soil Types:
- Alluvial
- Clay
- Loam
- Red
- Black

### 2. Leaf Disease Detection
- **Upload Leaf Image**: Detect diseases using YOLOv8.
- **Disease Types**:
  - Burns
  - Spots/Rots
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify whether immediate action is needed to save the plant.

---

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Soil Classification**:
   - Upload a soil image.
   - The system uses a trained CNN model to classify the soil type.
   - Receive crop recommendations based on the classification.

2. **Leaf Disease Detection**:
   - Upload a close-up image of a single leaf.
   - YOLOv8 detects diseases like burns or spots/rots.
   - Get actionable insights to maintain plant health.
